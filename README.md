# mass2mol
A Python implementation of the algorithm developed by Sebastian Bocker and Zsuzsanna Liptak (A Fast and Simple Algorithm for the Money Changing Problem, Algorithmica, 2007, 48, 413â€“432)

The mass2mol object generated the extended residue table for carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur with a blowup factor of 10^5 upon initialisation.

The combinations of CHNOPS atoms which have the same monoisotopic masses as a given mass can then be calculated using the find_formula method.
